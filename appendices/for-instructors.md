- **Teaching/learning activities**:
    - In class portion: 
        - Some lectures for those material that aren't coding heavily
        (e.g. for lessons to involve community, being a good community member)
        - Live coding (with instructor)
        - Exercises that expand on material covered with instructor that 
        solve a provided problem, with or without scaffolding
        - Could include dedicated group work sessions after the teamwork lessons
        (at end), with instructor and helpers available in class
    - Out of class: 
        - Individual project to build a package of a known problem, to solidify 
        their learning. Projects to choose from could be known and simple
        problems in data analysis that may or may not have already been
        implemented as an R package
        - Another individual but small project, done after the "involving
        community" chapter, to take existing packages that don't implement some
        best practices and improving them. Pull requests to original package
        would be optional and would only be done depending on whether maintain
        wants them.
            - For a potential list of packages, could include in "For Instructors"
            instructions for how to find packages that learners could use. (e.g.
            how to search through GitHub).
            - For self-learners, could provide some tips on how to find packages
            like this.
        - Group project to create a slightly more advanced R package based on a
        set of potential problems to choose from.
            - This is built as a set of instructions for instructors on how to 
            create this project that fits with the needs and context of the given
            class.
        - Informal formative assessments (or instructions on types that instructor 
        could use or make)
        - Reading assignments to motivate and inform on content given in-class

- **Content for the instructor and teaching assistant**
    - Such as guidelines and suggestions on what do to at each portion of the course
    for both instructor and teaching assistant
    - A TA could be assigned to a group and be the learners direct link to getting feedback
    and help
    - TA could act as Carpentry-style helpers during the live coding sessions
    - Guidelines on how to make this course either online or in person

- **Assessment and feedback activities**:
    - Deadlines for milestones to achieve for projects, with instructor feedback on progress
    - Out-of-class formative assessments based on maybe learnr tutorials?
    - After completing in-class exercises, go over them as class?
    - Peer review activities? E.g. exercises that have a rubric that go with them that can be used to guide peer review.
    - Assigned TA for group to get feedback on group work project?
    - Contribute to existing packages on GitHub by submitting PR
