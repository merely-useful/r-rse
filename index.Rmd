TODO: Add version of book here?

Welcome to our book! We are actively working on it, so it is largely a work in
progress.

Computers and computational work are essential components to conducting 
science and research. However, most introductions to software development
and programming focus on largely on developing commercial applications and not
often on the type of tasks and activities that researchers more commonly do,
like exploring problems and answering questions. This book will cover how to
create software as part of your research cycle. For researchers who build
software packages, this book will help prepare you for being a [research
software engineer][rse].

The course material was created using [rmarkdown] to write the lessons,
[bookdown] to create the book format, [GitHub] to host the [Git] 
repository of the material, and [GitHub Actions] to create the website.
The original source material for this book is found on the 
[`r-rse`] GitHub repository. For those interested in contributing, read the
[`README.md`](https://github.com/merely-useful/r-rse/blob/main/README.md)
for more information.
