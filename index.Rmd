Computers and computational work are essential components to conducting
science and research. However, most introductions to software
development and programming focus on largely on developing commercial
applications and not often on the type of tasks and activities that
researchers more commonly do, like exploring problems and answering
questions. This book will cover how to create software as part of your
research cycle. For researchers who build software packages, this book
will help prepare you for being a research software engineer.

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and to build the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to create the website. The
original source material for this book is found on the
[`r-rse`](https://github.com/merely-useful/r-rse) GitHub repository. For
those interested in contributing, read the
[`README.md`](https://github.com/merely-useful/r-rse/blob/main/README.md)
