# Folder and file structure (RStudio R Projects)

- Very basics of the shell (in RStudio),
and filesystem terminology
  - `cd`, `ls`, flags
  - recursive
  - paths: home and root
- Working directory and how it is set with RStudio R Projects
- Making use of the `fs` package for filesystem management
  - similar functions in base R and why `fs` is preferred
  - `dir_ls()`, `dir_tree()`
  - `dir_map()`
  - `file_delete()`, `file_info()`, `file_move()`

## Final exercise {02-final-exercise}

The exercises in this chapter check your understanding of fundamental concepts represented here,
but the tasks performed do not directly contribute to the project assignment.
We'll learn ways in the next chapter to create the essential elements required for a package project,
and begin working on your assignment.

1. Create a new RStudio project called `practice_filesystem`,
and answer the following questions:
  - What is the absolute path to your project directory?
  - If you close RStudio, how can you ensure your working directory is your project directory when you next open the application?

2. Using your `practice_filesystem` project created in the previous exercise,
write the commands you can use to perform the following tasks with functions from `fs`:
  - List all of the files in your project.
  - Create a new directory called `practice_files/` containing files named `example1.txt` and `example_script.R`.
  - Move `example1.txt` to your main project directory.
  - Delete `practice_files/` and everything it contains.
