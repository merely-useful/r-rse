# Folder and file structure for R projects

## Learning Objectives

* interact with the RStudio interface to navigate files and directories
* interpret paths as locations within folders
* create RStudio projects and identify the working directory
* apply functions from the `fs` package for filesystem management

## Laying the foundation

* text: This chapter serves two purposes:
  * confirm everyone has the same baseline knowledge
  * introduce foundational skills on which we'll build in subsequent chapters

* text (and image?): referencing most recognizable panes of RStudio interface and their default locations
  * Console: left side, where code is executed
  * Environment: top right side, lists names of defined objects and information about them
  * Files: lower right side, browser for navigating directories and files (other tabs in this pane include Plots, Packages, and Help)
  * note appendix with customization options for RStudio

> popout about RStudio terminal: way to access the Unix shell from within RStudio. 
- Other methods of interacting with the shell include Terminal (Mac OSX), or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Git-Bash (also Windows).
- some version control tasks can only be accomplished on the command line
- remote computing requires a remote login

## Creating a project

* text (image?): one of the challenges of software engineering is keeping our code and associated files organized
  * we use projects to make these tasks easier
  * define working directory
  * if you are looking at RStudio with no project open, you'll see the working directory listed at the top of the Console as `~/` (or Windows equivalent)

* text: working directory does not necessarily match the file browser in lower right pane
* text: changing the working directory can make it easier to reference files and directories 

* text: paths represent a location in your computer, and are comprised of directory names separated by slashes (or backslashes?)
  * absolute paths
  * relative paths
  * `~` as home directory

* text (image): create a new project
  * File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project
  * Directory name: `sassafras`
  * Create project as subdirectory of: `~/Desktop` (or the equivalent on a Windows machine?); may need to use Browse button
  * Click "Create Project"

* text: what happens after creating a project?
  * screen refreshes and path to working directory changes (ends in name of project you just created)
* text: interpreting output:
  * if creating a new project, creates a folder in the specified location that includes hidden files containing information about your project
  * RStudio references that information to make it easier for us to focus on writing code (includes working directory and our preferences)
  
  * `.` prefacing a file name means the file is hidden
  * `.` and `..` as shortcuts to folders (current and parent file, respectively)

* text: why aren't we creating a project to use in later chapters? Here we use a project to get warmed up in a low-stakes way.
  * while creating your project, you may have noticed the option to create a package, as these are more specialized, structured types of projects
  * we won't be working with RStudio projects in subsequent chapters, but they demonstrate a few important principles that will help you understand how and why we perform certain actions later

## Managing files and directories with `fs`

* text: introduce {fs} as the recommended approach for working with the filesystem (files, directories, and paths)
  * could use shell, but sometimes commands for common tasks are complex, and it's inconvenient to move back and forth between your R Console and shell
  * could use same functions in base R includes, 
  * {fs} combines the best features of both shell and base R filesystem management, creating a standardized interface for interacting with your files and directories with intuitive names for the functions involved
* text: {fs} provides additional advantages when creating R packages:
  * vectorization
  * predictable return values
  * explicit failure
  * doesn't rely on native system encoding (makes everything UTF-8)

* text: we'll look at some of the most common functions from {fs} relevant to development of a data analysis package:
  * identifying and locating data files
  * saving intermediate and final output files
* text: {fs} functions have three different categories, prefaced with:
  * `dir_` operate on directories
  * `file_ ` operate on files
  * `path_` operate on paths
  * while covering all useful functions is outside the scope of thsi chapter, we'll demonstrate a few to help you understand their breadth of applications

* code: `dir_ls()` to list files in current directory
  * providing no argument defaults to the current working directory
  * if your working directory is `sassafras`, you'll only have one file shown here (`sassafras.Rproj`)
* code: `dir_ls("Desktop")`: indicate a different directory by including the path as an argument 
  * don't forget to enclose the path inside quotation marks
  * can be relative or absolute path
  * useful when inspecting what files have been created from a function you've run in R
* code: `dir_tree()` as a different way of listing files and directories
  * output is formatted differently
  * recursive: shows files and subdirectories in the specified directory, then all files and subdirectories in those subdirectories, until there are no directories to list
  * note there is an argument to make `dir_ls` recursive, too!
  * useful if you need to inspect output but aren't quite sure where it has been saved (run a tree of the entire project)
* code: `file_copy(path, new_path)` to duplicate a file
* code: `file_info()` to show details like size, permissions, and date modified for a file
* code: `file_delete()` to remove files that are no longer needed
* text: even if these functions don't appear in your final package, they are very useful while writing and debugging your code

## Final exercise {#02-final-exercise}

The exercises in this chapter check your understanding of fundamental concepts represented here,
but the tasks performed do not directly contribute to the project assignment.
We'll learn ways in the next chapter to create the essential elements required for a package project,
and begin working on your assignment.

1. Create a new RStudio project called `practice_filesystem`,
and answer the following questions:
  * What is the absolute path to your project directory?
  * If you close RStudio, how can you ensure your working directory is your project directory when you next open the application?

2. Using your `practice_filesystem` project created in the previous exercise,
write the commands you can use to perform the following tasks with functions from `fs`:
  * List all of the files in your project.
  * Create a new directory called `practice_files/` containing files named `example1.txt` and `example_script.R`.
  * Move `example1.txt` to your main project directory.
  * Delete `practice_files/` and everything it contains.
