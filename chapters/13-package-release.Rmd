# Preparing for package release

- Check builds on other systems (with rhub)
- Etiquette for using (mostly free) servers and external build systems like GitHub Actions and rhub (e.g. do not overuse them)
- Managing your versions, git tagging



## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

The purpose of this exercise is for the participant to go through an iteration of doing an R CMD check of the package in remote systems, understanding how to use these systems and lastly practice how to tag git commits to track versions.

A. Check builds on other systems (with rhub)
<!--> https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/articles/rhub.html-->

1. Validate email with rhub
> `rhub::validate_email("youremail@email.com")`

2. Run a package check against the directory
> `rhub::check()`

3. Run a package check against the tarball
> `devtools::build()`
> `rhub::check(<tarball>)`

4. Run a package check against a specific OS
> `rhub::check(<OS>)`

5. Browse previous checks
> `rhub::list_package_checks()`

B. Etiquette for using (mostly free) servers and external build systems like GitHub Actions and rhub (e.g. do not overuse them)

1. Read the usage limits on GitHub Actions and rhub
> - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration
> - https://docs.r-hub.io/#regularly
TODO: Add a question to assess whether they've read it?

1(b). Run the GitHub Actions for the package, locally (optional)
> https://github.com/nektos/act

1(c). Run the rhub check locally (optional)
> https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/articles/local-debugging.html

C. Managing your versions, git tagging

1. Upgrade version in the R package
> In the DESCRIPTION file, use `usethis::use_version()` to modify the minor version number

2. Build your package and commit
> `devtools::build()`
> `git commit`

3. Tag your commit (version # is flexible)
> `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version Tag 1.0"`
TODO: Use use_release_issue() as well?
