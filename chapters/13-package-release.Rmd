# Preparing for package release {#package-release}

- Check builds on other systems (with rhub)
- Etiquette for using (mostly free) servers and external build systems like GitHub Actions and rhub (e.g. do not overuse them)
- Managing your versions, git tagging, DOI?
- ORCID here?

TODO: This could be a core exercise instead
1. Validate email with rhub
> `rhub::validate_email("youremail@email.com")`

TODO: This question would be better suited as a core exercise, not in the final exercise
1. Read the usage limits on GitHub Actions and rhub
> - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/usage-limits-billing-and-administration
> - https://docs.r-hub.io/#regularly
TODO: Add a question to assess whether they've read it?

## Final exercise

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub. Make use of the usethis `pr_*` workflow
described in Chapter \@ref(github-workflows).

1. Run a package check with `rhub::check()` against an OS different from your
own. For instance, if you use Windows, run a check on Mac OS or Linux.
    - For Mac checks, use `rhub::check_on_macos()`.
    - For Linux checks, use `rhub::check_on_linux()`.
    - For Windows checks, use `rhub::check_on_windows()`.

TODO: Add task about checking results from within R? (eg. get_check())
2. Browse your previous checks with `rhub::list_package_checks()`.

TODO: I'm hesitant about this one. Seems like its a bit of work to install, its a third-party app and might change. 
1(b). Run the GitHub Actions for the package, locally (optional)
> https://github.com/nektos/act

TODO: This one requires installing Docker and I think that's outside the scope of this course.
1(c). Run the rhub check locally (optional)
> https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/articles/local-debugging.html

3. Upgrade your R package minor version number with
`usethis::use_version("minor")`.

TODO: Need to think about another way to do this, maybe instead with the gert package?
3. Tag your commit (version # is flexible)
> `git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version Tag 1.0"`
TODO: Use use_release_issue() as well?
