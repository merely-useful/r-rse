# Setting up an R package {#package-setup}

- Describing what a package is and when or why to make one
    - Use [available](https://github.com/r-lib/available) to make a name (naming is hard).
- Using devtools, usethis for development
    - e.g. `use_devtools()` and `use_usethis()`.
- Developing functions
- Basic explanation of what a function is and its components
- Making and using datasets
- Downloading zipf data at this point, using `usethis::use_data_raw()`, write the script to download the data and process into `data/` via `usethis::use_data()`.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify when to create an R package
* Create a new R package using `usethis::create_package()`
* Describe the purpose of the folders and files in a skeleton R package
* Add data to an R package
* Set global defaults to ease package development with devtools and usethis

## About Zipf's Law

We'll create a package (`zipfs`) to analyze a fascinating result in the field of
quantitative linguistics. Zipf’s Law states that the second most common word in
a body of text appears half as often as the most common, the third most common
appears a third as often, and so on. To test whether Zipf’s Law holds for a
collection of classic novels that are freely available from Project Gutenberg,
we will write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency
distribution in any arbitrary body of text.

## Outline of action steps

* Why create an R package? 

    * Text: Whenever you want to use data or functions over more than one project.
    * Text: Advantages over sharing code and/or data files:
        * Easy for other people to obtain and install
        * Built-in documentation of functions and data
        * Incorporate package-level meta data: authors, version, etc.

* What is an R package?

    * Text: Files that follow the R package conventions. usethis and devtools, 
    designed to help you do this.  
    * Exercise: Install a simple package from GitHub.
    Give some code that: loads package, 
    calls `xxx()` and data `yyy`.  
    Examine structure of GitHub repo.   
    Can you find where is the `xxx()` defined?  `yyy`? 
    Where is the name of the package? 
    
* Creating a package    

    * Text: Where should your package live? What should you call your package?
    * Code: `usethis::create_package()` (maybe also `available::available()`?)
        * Note about using `::` vs `library()`
    * Text: `DESCRIPTION` is structured text that describes package, 
    `R/` for R script files that define functions in the package. 
    * Exercise: Repeat steps, e.g. `usethis::create_package("zipfs")`, 
    edit `DESCRIPTION` to have you as author.
 

* Package development workflow
    
    * Text: As an example, add a function to this package. 
    Here, function is provided, next chapter, talks about how you
    write functions. 
    * Code: `use_r()`
    * Text: How do we load the function and check it works?
    * Code: `devtools::load_all()`
    * Exercise: Practice workflow. Make small edit to function, reload, 
    rerun function.
    * Text: `load_all()` emulates installing and loading, but only
    for current session.  Sometimes you want to actually install and load.
    * Code: `devtools::install()`, `library()`
    
* Adding data to a package

    * Text: Data live in `data/` as `.rda` files.  
    * Code: `usethis::use_data("FIXME")` Here with simplified data. Restart, `devtools::load_all()`, `FIXME`
    * Text: Should document how data was created. 
    Put raw data and scripts that end in `usethis::use_data()` in `data-raw/`
    * Code: `use_data_raw()` 
    * Exercise: Provide script for getting dracula text from Gutenberg. 
    Add `dracula` to package.

* R settings that help you as a developer
    
    * Text: `usethis::` `devtools::` get tiresome to type.  Setup to always load.
    * Code: `usethis::use_devtools()` `usethis::use_usethis()`
    * Text: When we restart R, want nothing in environment, no packages loaded, etc.
    * Code: `use_blank_slate()`
    * Text: Other configuration, e.g. to automatically populate `DESCRIPTION`:  https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#store-default-values-for-description-fields-and-other-preferences
    
    
## Final exercise

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment for exact details on what you are required to
create and on what the package should do. For this exercise, we will be using
a package about weather in Kenya as an example and reference.

1. Decide on a simple but descriptive name for your new package. Use
[available][pkg-available] to see if the name is taken.

2. Use `create_package()` to create a new package. While you can create this
package anywhere on your computer, for now we suggest either your `Desktop/` or
maybe something like `Documents/r-pkgs/`.

3. Open the `DESCRIPTION` file and update the file with:
    * Yourself as the author in the `Authors@R:` field.
    * A one sentence description of the package in the `Title:` field.
    * Two or three sentence summary of the package in the `Description:` field.

4. Add some data to the package. Use `use_data_raw()` to create the `data-raw/`
folder along with a script for cleaning the raw data. Then put the data in this
newly created folder. Write in some simple data cleaning processes in the cleaning
R script and follow the steps in Section FIXME to make the FIXME data available
as part of the package.
 
You'll know you are finished if:

* Your package can be installed with `install()` (or `Ctrl-Shift-B` to build it).
* In a fresh R session, after running `library(FIXME)` you can access the data
by its name.

TODO: Add actions done to kenyaweather package here?
