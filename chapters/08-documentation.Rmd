## Learning Objectives {#learning-objectives-8}

* Describe the purpose of documenting code and packages
* Document functions with `roxygen`
* Create a README and vignette for package documentation
* Ensure that documentation is consistent with up-to-date style guidelines
using `styler`

## Why do we need documentation? {#introduction}

Just like version control tracks what changes you make and why, documentation for code and packages tells your collaborators, your package's users, and future you *what* the code does and *why*.

Over time, programming languages have become more "human-readable": it is possible for an experienced programmer to read code and understand what it does. But even if one understands *what* a chunk of code is doing, it may not be obvious at all *why* it does that! Programming languages come with built-in ways to add comments and documentation that are not read by the computer, but exist solely to help you and your collaborators describe and understand code. Good documentation is key for openness, reproducibility, and project sustainability.

Good documentation happens at all scales of code: at the level of individual objects, functions, and tests as well as for the entire package. In this chapter, we describe the workflow of documentation alongside package development and outline the components of a well-documented package.

## Documenting functions and tests with `roxygen` {#function-documentation}

In R, documentation files for objects are stored by default in the `man/` folder in your package directory with a `.Rd` extension. These help files can be accessed for an object, function, or package by typing `?object-name` or `help(object-name)`. Writing documentation for functions as you write the function itself is helpful for future you and other users to understand how to use your code. You can edit these documentation files directly, but the package `{roxygen2}` provides some shortcuts to make it easier to generate the help files with standard formatting. 

Let's add documentation for the function `extract_element()` from the `zipfs` package. First, all we need to do is write the function itself.  

```{r cs-extract-element}
extract_element <- function(text, element){
  line <- str_subset(text, element)
  str_remove(line, element)
}
```

Next, with your cursor over the function definition, click `Code > Insert roxygen skeleton` in RStudio (or use the command palette with `Ctrl-Shift-P` and then type out `roxygen` to search for the option). This command adds the default components of function documentation as comments above the function. 

```{r cs-extract-element}
#' Title
#'
#' @param text 
#' @param element 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
extract_element <- function(text, element){
  line <- str_subset(text, element)
  str_remove(line, element)
}
```

We can edit the default template to add more information in each field. The fields `@return` and `@export` are optional, depending on the function's behavior. We'll also add an example of how to use the function.

<!-- TODO: perhaps include a deliberate typo here to be caught later by `spelling`?-->

```{r cs-extract-element}
#' Title
#'
#' @param text A string of text
#' @param element A substring to search for in `text`
#'
#' @return The matching line without the text matched by `element`
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' text <- "Title: Dracula"
#' extract_element(text, "Title: ")
extract_element <- function(text, element){
  line <- str_subset(text, element)
  str_remove(line, element)
}
```

Next, press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D` or run `devtools::document()` in the Console to generate or update a file named `man/extract_element.Rd`. Try typing `?extract_element()` in the console to see what happens! (You may need to run `devtools::load_all()` in order to test out the new help file.)

<!-- TODO: I wasn't able to get the man file to generate - 'Error: Clipboard on X11 requires that the DISPLAY envvar be configured.' -->

### Exercise: Add roxygen comments to functions in `zipfs` {#ex-roxygen}

<!-- TODO: All functions in the draft package have documentation except `dpower` and `nllpower` - we can document these ones, or take out other documentation to do this exercise. -->

Follow the steps above to add documentation for the `dpower` and `nllpower` functions in the `zipfs` package.
What files are created in the `man/` folder when multiple functions in the same file are documented?

### Documenting tests

TODO: Decide if this is needed based on what is put into chapter 6.

  * Code: FIXME test documentation workflow
  * Exercise: add and/or improve comments and documentation in a test file in
the `zipfs` package.

## The README - the first stop documentation shop {#create-readme}

<!-- Some bits from py-rse/packaging -->

When a user or contributor first encounters a package,
they usually want to know what the package is meant to do,
instructions on how to install it,
and examples of how to use it.
We can include these elements in the README file.

The function `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` creates an
R Markdown document with some boilerplate sections and text.
These default "Installation" and "Example" sections are a
great starting point to create a helpful and descriptive README.

```{r cs-readme, eval=TRUE}
use_readme_rmd()
```

### Exercise: R Markdown vs. Mardown {#ex-rmd-md}

Read the help file for `use_readme_rmd()` and `use_readme_md()`.
What is the difference between `.Rmd` and `.md` files? Why might one or the
other be better for a README?

GitHub treats the file `README.md` specially, displaying it at
the top of your repo for easy access. The README created by
`use_readme_rmd()` contains the following helpful tips about the reasons
to use an R markdown README instead of just writing it in
markdown directly:

> What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
>
> ```{r cars}
> summary(cars)
> ```
>
> You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
> You can also embed plots, for example:
>
> ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
> plot(pressure)
> ```
>
> In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

### Knitting the markdown README {#knit-readme}

To create the markdown README that GitHub will display, you can use `knitr` to
knit the RMD file into `README.md`. The YAML text `output: github_document`
included in the template tells `knitr` to create a markdown output for GitHub
instead of the default HTML.
In RStudio, click `Knit` in the menu above the editor, or run
`devtools::build_readme()` in the console as suggested by the template text.
<!-- what's the difference between build_readme() and knit?-->

### Exercise: Edit and knit the `zipfs` README {#ex-readme}

Edit `README.Rmd` to include a description of `zipfs`, installation
instructions, and an example of its use.
Knit the `README.Rmd` file so it creates a `README.md` file.

## Vignettes: long-form documentation of examples {#vignette}

Everything we've discussed about documentation so far applies to all
programming projects in nearly any language: all programming languages
provide some way to document code, and all GitHub projects have READMEs.
"Vignettes" are a distinctly R type of documentation - they describe
a problem-solving unit of your package in detail, with examples.

The function `browseVignettes()` allows you to, you guessed it, browse
existing vignettes. Calling `browseVignettes()` with no arguments will
open a browser window with a list of vignettes for all installed
packages, while `browseVignettes("packagename")` will show vignettes
for a particular package. You can also call up a vignette directly
if you know its name with `vignette("vignettename")`.

```{r cs-vignette, eval=False}
browseVignettes("tidyr")
vignette("nest")
```

### Exercise: finding vignettes {#ex-find-vignette}

Find the vignette(s) for the packages `devtools` and `ggplot2`.
Why might a package have more than one vignette? In what ways is a vignette
different from a README?

### Making a vignette {#make-vignette}

Once again, `usethis` has a useful function to help us create vignettes.
The function `usethis::use_vignette()` takes a package name and vignette
title and creates a short template R markdown document in the `vignettes` folder.

```{r cs-create-vignette, eval=True}
use_vignette("zipfs", title = "Using zipfs")`
```

The boilerplate text is very minimal. Try knitting the file `zipfs.Rmd`
to see what's included by default - it's not much. Vignettes can vary a
lot depending on the goals of the author; they can be long or short,
[simple](http://127.0.0.1:28784/library/devtools/doc/dependencies.html) or
[complex](http://127.0.0.1:28784/library/ggplot2/doc/extending-ggplot2.html).

### Exercise: edit a `zipfs` vignette {#ex-edit-vignette}

<!-- This might be too involved for a single exercise -->

Modify the vignette `zipfs.Rmd` (in the `vignettes` folder) to include a
one-paragraph description
of the purpose of `zipfs`, and an example of how to use the `zipfs` functions
together to analyze a book. Knit the file to preview the vignette.

## Writing in style - the housekeeping help of `styler` and `spelling` {#styler-spelling}

When writing code, some aspects of formatting are very strict, but there
are still choices a programmer can make about the appearance and content
of code. For instance, R strictly requires that parentheses be properly
paired in order for code to function (`print("hi")` will run, `print("hi"`
will not), but things like variable names and the position of whitespace
are more flexible. To create code that is maximally understandable,
many communities have developed *style guides* that outline guidance
for how to write clear code and documentation. Check out the
[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)'s
[syntax](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html) section for examples
of the types of stylistic decisions we make when writing code.

Different communities may disagree on certain aspects of style.
[Google's R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)
lists differences between their guide and the tidyverse style guide:
for instance, tidyverse recommends that all object names be written in
`snake_case` (lowercase with underscores), while Google prefers function
names to be written in `BigCamelCase` (capitalizing the first letter of
each word). Which style guide you adhere to will depend on who your project
is for, who you're working with, and on your own personal preferences.

It's possible to adhere to a style guide by remembering the rules and
applying them yourself, but luckily there are tools that can help automate
the boring parts. The package `styler` automatically formats code according
to a specified style guide: simply run `styler::style_pkg()` to format
your code according to the tidyverse style guide by default.

In the same spirit, the package `spelling` does a spell check on the
documentation files in a package. Run `spelling::spell_check_package()`
prints a list of potential spelling errors and their locations to the
console; unlike `styler`, it does not modify files.

### Exercise: checking style {#ex-styler}

Run `style_pkg()` to restyle the files in the `zipfs` package. Use Git to
explore some of the changes that were made. What do you notice?

### Exercise: checking spelling {#ex-spelling}

Run `spell_check_package()` to check the spelling in the `zipfs`
documentation files. Fix the errors, then run `update_wordlist()` to add
any special words to the spell-checker that you want to ignore.

## Final exercise {#08-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub.

1. Add the ability to write your roxygen2 documentation using Markdown with 
`usethis::use_roxygen_md()`.

2. Go through your existing function documentations and fill them in more.
Especially focus on completing the `@param`, `@return`, and `@examples` fields.
Then run `document()` (`Ctrl-Shift-D`).

3. Create a README file for your repository by using `use_readme_rmd()`.
    - Edit the `README.Rmd` to include a description of your package and its
    purpose, installation instructions, and one or more examples of how to use it.
    - Knit the `README.Rmd` file so it creates a `README.md` file.

4. Add a vignette to your project package by running `use_vignette("YOURPACKAGENAME")`,
replacing `YOURPACKAGENAME` with the name of your actual project package.
Edit the vignette to include a:
	- Higher-level paragraph describing your package and its purpose.
	- An example of how to use your package, including code, that's more complete
	than what the README might have.
    - Use `knitr` to Knit and preview your vignette.

4. (*Alternate*) Add a vignette to your project that describes how your package
interacts with another published R package. <!--leaflet?-->
    - Use `knitr` to Knit and preview your vignette.

5. Check the spelling and style of your files in your package by running
`styler::style_pkg()` to restyle your files and `use_spell_check()` to check the
spelling. Fix any problems and if there are any special words, create a
new file in `inst/WORDLIST`, add the word, and run `spelling::update_wordlist()`.
Then re-run these styling and spelling checks to confirm no problems exist anymore.
