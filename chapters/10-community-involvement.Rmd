* Understand the purpose of licensing content, choose a license and create a LICENSE file
* Understand the importance of contributing guidelines and how to develop them for a project
* Create and manage GitHub Issues to track project bugs and improvements

## Outline of action steps

This chapter is very description-heavy with minimal code.

- Creating a welcoming community with welcoming materials
<!-- I grouped reprex and NEWS with the README because they seem related to the general welcoming presentation of a project, but they could go elsewhere. -->

  - Text: making your project approachable with a welcoming README ([Mozilla reference](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), [R packages reference](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#readme)).
  - Exercise: write a one-paragraph description of the `zipfs` package using the [Up-Goer Five Text Editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/).
  - Text: making your project easy to use and understand with reproducible examples. `reprex`: not just for bug reports!
  - Code: use the `reprex` package to create a minimal reproducible example for a function in the `zipfs` package.
  - Exercise: use `reprex` to create a minimal reproducible example for the `book-meta` function in the `zipfs` package (or another function not described in the code section).
  - Text: using a NEWS file ([reference](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#news)). How and when to update the NEWS file.
  - Code: `usethis::use_news_md()`
  - Exercise: make an edit to `NEWS.md` in the `zipfs` package describing the most recent change that was make to the structure or code of `zipfs` (FIXME: we can be more specific here, like referring to a change made in the previous chapter.)

- Code of Conduct

  - Text: inclusivity and safety with a focus on package users and community contributors, the purpose of a Code of Conduct and what goes into one ([reference](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-a-code-of-conduct/)).
  - Code: `usethis::use_code_of_conduct()`
  - Exercise: read the Code of Conduct file in the `zipfs` package and edit it to include a method of contact for reporting violations. Add details for how violations will be handled (for example, banning from project, blocking, etc.).

- Licensing

  - Text: why do you need a license, what is the purpose of a license ([reference](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/sharing-your-work-in-the-open/))
    - what happens when code is unlicensed. Copyrighted and not re-usable.
  - Code: `usethis::use_NAME_license` i.e. `usethis::use_mit_license()`
  - Exercises:
      - Explore [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) and read about the different types of open source licenses.
      - Choose two open source products that you have used (for example [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/), [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/LICENSE.md), or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/about/license/)). Find and read the license for each product.

- Contributing guidelines

  - Text: the purpose of Contributing guidelines and what they can contain ([reference](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/)). Emphasize that the different sections are quite project-specific (i.e. your project might not use communication channels outside of GitHub).
  - Code: `usethis::use_tidy_contributing()`
  - Exercise: choose two open source products that you have used and find their contributing guidelines. Do they contain any sections that aren't in the default Tidy Contributing Guidelines that you think are useful?

- Project management for a user-friendly package

  - Text: creating, using, and managing GitHub Issues to maintain your project. GitHub Issues provides a way to log bugs and project improvement suggestions from you, collaborators, and your user community. Creating [issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) for bugs and feature requests.
  - Exercise: create an issue template for reporting bugs in the `zipfs` package.
  - Exercise: create an issue describing a possible new feature or enhancement for the `zipfs` package.
  - Text: project maintenance, longevity and sustainability. Possible areas to cover: [project maintenance](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/open-project-maintenance/open-project-maintenance/), contributor [personas and pathways](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/), [leadership structure](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/understand-meaningful-participation-and-distributed-leadership/), [event planning and facilitation](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/running-awesome-community-events/event-planning-and-facilitation/).

<!---
NOTE: This is potential content to use, if it fits.

And some people still worry that if they make their data and code generally available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn't stop people using it as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn't just [impostor syndrome][impostor-syndrome]:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.

## Final exercise {#10-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub. For more information and tips at any
step, refer to the 
[Mozilla Open Leadership Training Series resources](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/readme/)

1. Review your project package's `README.Rmd`:
    - Write a one-paragraph description of your package using the 
    [Up-Goer Five Text Editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/). *Note*: You don't
    need to use this in your actual README, but it is a fun and informative
    exercise to see and understand what words you think are common, but might not be!
    - Review your `README.Rmd` file by trying to place yourself with the
    viewpoint of a new contributor to your project. Does your README clearly
    explain the purpose and function of your package without using jargon? Make
    as many additions, deletions, and revisions as you'd like until you feel
    your README is clear and welcoming.
    - After editing your `README.Rmd` file, make sure to knit the `README.md`
    version so it gets properly displayed on GitHub.
 
2. Add a Code of Conduct to your package repository:
    - Create a file in your package called `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` by running
    `usethis::use_code_of_conduct()`. This function automatically populates your
    Code of Conduct with the
    [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). 
    The newly created file will be in the `.github/` folder. 
    You may keep or modify the template, or you may draft your own entirely.
    Make sure to attribute the source of any outside text you use or modify, and
    make sure the license of the text you use permits your use or modification.
    Here are some other example codes of conduct:
        - [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md)
        - [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/)
    - Include a link to your Code of Conduct in your `README.Rmd`. Knit the
    file so it updates the `README.md` version.
 
3. Create a contributing guidelines file for your package repository:
    - Create a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` by running
    `usethis::use_tidy_contributing()`. 
    The newly created file will be in the `.github/` folder. 
    This file will contain information for
    people interacting with your project about how they can use your package
    and/or how they can get involved. Review the newly created file and
    revise it as necessary. For some examples of great Contributing
    Guidelines, check out:
        - [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        - [Data Carpentry Geospatial R lesson](https://github.com/datacarpentry/r-intro-geospatial/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
        - [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/contribute/)
    - The default `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` file you created has a template for
    instructions for submitting changes or reporting a problem. Modify
    the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to include the following:
        - A welcome statement and a brief description of your project.
        - A list of project-related resources, like a link to your README.
        - A list of communication channels your project uses, if applicable
        (mailing lists, forums, chat clients, GitHub Issues, etc.)
        TODO: The above might be more appropriate for the project management
        section.
        - Instructions for how to submit changes or report a problem, specific
        to your project.
        - A description of how you recognize contributors.
        - Instructions on where to go for help: who to contact and how.
        - A link to your Code of Conduct.
 
4. Add a license to your repository for terms of re-use of your package:
    - Choose a license for your package. Visit
    [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) and choose a license that
    makes sense for your project. This license will live in a file called
    `LICENSE.md` in the top level folder of your project. If you choose a common
    license, it's likely that you can create `LICENSE.md` by running
    `usethis::use_mit_license()` (for the MIT License) or another related
    `usethis::use_NAME_license()` function. Licensing is a complex thing
    so for now, choose the MIT License.

5. Project management
- Create an [issue template](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository) for your project, providing guidelines for what you think might be the most common category of issue that contributors and users might submit.
- Add a line to CONTRIBUTING.md requesting that new issues use the template if applicable.
- FIXME: this might be a good place to go through the [Personas and Pathways](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) exercise, focusing on user and contributor personas, then add something to CONTRIBUTING.md about the target user of the package.

6. Create a NEWS file to your repository about changes you make to it:
    - Create a file called `NEWS.md` in the top level of your project by running
    `usethis::use_news_md()`.
    - Review the [Tidyverse NEWS style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html)
    on best practices for writing in your NEWS file.

7. Create a reprex to practice creating Reproducible Examples for debugging and
getting help:
    - Use the `reprex` package to create a minimal reproducible example for one
    of the functions in your package.
    - Add your process for using the reprex, and what you've learned from it,
    into the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, as an example of how to contribute
    and use issues.
