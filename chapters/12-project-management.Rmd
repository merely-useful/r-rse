# Project management of your package development (either solo or in a team) {#project-management}

- Project [roadmaps][project-roadmap]
- Issue tracking
    - These can range from simple project improvements (like scanning for typos in the README) to complex feature additions or bugs to be fixed.
- Labeling
    - Labels should make sense for your project, i.e. good first bug, discussion, help wanted, documentation, feature, etc. 
- Project boards
    - If you prefer GitHub Projects, create a GitHub Project for your package. Organize your issues from left to right in some version of "to-do", "in-progress", and "complete".
- Milestones

## Final exercise {#12-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub. Make use of the usethis `pr_*` workflow
described in Chapter \@ref(github-workflows).

1. Create a [roadmap][project-roadmap] for your project describing short-term,
medium-term, and long-term project goals. For now keep these goals about completing
the first project assignment. This can be a GitHub issue or a file called
`ROADMAP.md`. TODO: We should decide on one, to restrict learners choice.

2. Using your roadmap as inspiration for todo items, create new Issues for a few
of your project's tasks.
    - Create several new Issue Labels. GitHub provides a few good default ones.
    Add some new ones like FIXME: Add specific labels here, other than the ones
    that github makes.
    - Add a link in your `CONTRIBUTING.md` to Issues with the label `good first
    bug` so new contributors know where they can get started.
    - In your roadmap, add links to relevant Issues for others (and yourself)
    to be able to quickly find and look over.

TODO: This exercise might be more appropriate as a core exercise of this chapter, rather than part of the final one.
3. Look at some examples of packages that use GitHub Milestones and GitHub Projects. Are there situations in which one project management approach is better than the other? Which do you prefer, or which do you feel suits your project better?
    - Milestone examples:
        - [ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/milestones)
	- FIXME: more examples?
    - Project examples:
        - [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/projects)
	- FIXME: more examples?

4. Depending on whether you prefer Milestones or Projects, create one for your
project for finishing this first project assignment.
