# Version control: Using Git and GitHub as a sole user (part 1)

Emphasize exercises to practice,
not showing output of git in code chunks (they are a pain to edit afterwards).

Clearly identify which tasks are best accomplished by each interface.

- Using Git integration in RStudio (standard add-commit-history)
- Using Git in the Terminal of RStudio
  - moving in history with checkout
  - creating branches
  - adding and updating remotes
- Setting up GitHub for R package (make use of `usethis`), pushing and pulling

## Final exercise {#05-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment for exact details on what you are required to
create and on what the package should do. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.

TODO: This question makes a change to zipfs, so this should be reflected in any automation we do to it.

1. For the `zipfs` previously used for demonstration in this chapter,
perform the following tasks:
    - Initialize the repository (`use_git()` in the R Console).
    - Open up a Terminal and create a new branch called `new-feature` with `git`.
    - Open up any file and make a minor change (e.g. add a word like "random").
    In the RStudio Git Interface, add and commit those changes into the history.
    - Go back to the main branch by using checkout with `git`. 
    - Think about and consider what will happen if you attempt to merge your
    branches? In the Terminal, merge the changes from the `new-feature` branch
    into the `main` branch and find out.

2. Go to your package for your first project assignment and perform the
following tasks, noting the approach you used (Git integration in RStudio,
command-line interface, `usethis`):
    - Initialize the repository (`use_git()` in the R Console).
    - In the RStudio Git Interface, add and commit all the relevant files that
    you've worked on until this point. Are there any you need to ignore? 
    TODO: Should we have this thing about ignore? At this point would there be anything?
    - Connect your new Git repository to GitHub (`use_github()` in the R Console)
    and push the changes up.
    - Go to your newly created GitHub repository and confirm that your history 
    has been uploaded to GitHub.

TODO: Add actions done to kenyaweather package here?
