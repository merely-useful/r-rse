# Version control: Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Learning objectives {#05-learning-objectives}

* identify why version control, specifically Git, is important for software engineering
* differentiate methods for working with Git and R: RStudio integration, `usethis` and `gert` functions
* apply the change-stage-commit process as the Git workflow for tracking changes and viewing a repository's commit history
* publish repositories to GitHub and coordinate between remote and local versions

## Introduction to version control {#intro-version-control}

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code and other types of files.
If you've used tracked changes in Microsoft Word or Google Docs,
you're already familiar with using version control to track changes to documents.
A version control system, or software used to implement version control,
is an essential part of software engineering because of the history it retains
of who made what changes and when.

Git is a version control system,
while GitHub is a website for publishing and sharing projects that are tracked using Git. 
Git and GitHub are a very popular set of tools used by both academic and commercial organizations, 
and correspondingly, 
have well-developed help documentation and a large community of users to assist in their use.
Version control is used to record changes to all types of files, 
but is especially important for code. 
This is because changes made to code may have consequences for other parts of the file or project, 
and being able to understand when and where changes caused problems is especially important.

In this chapter,
we'll introduce version control by tracking the files to our project created so far,
navigating the Git workflow within the context of project development,
both while exploring different ways to interact with Git in RStudio.

## The basic Git workflow {#git-workflow}

There are many different ways to interact with Git version control software.
For the purposes of this book,
we'll be using two of these approaches:
the Git interface in RStudio, 
and R functions that implement Git commands
through the `usethis` and `gert` packages.

See the [appendix]
for more information on setting up Git and GitHub,
and make sure you can access Git via RStudio prior to continuing with this chapter.

### Getting started with Git in RStudio {#git-rstudio}

* Git and RStudio
  * accessing Git through Global options
  * tab in environment pane

* setting global parameters
  * name
  * email

* Initializing a repository
  * creates hidden folder containing git history
  * some files ignored (note that it's possible to add other files to ignore)

### Exercise: initialize repository {#ex-initialize}

initializing with GUI

`usethis::use_git` to initialize repository

### Tracking changes {#tracking-changes}

explain git workflow

### Exercise: track existing files in project {#ex-tracking}

* work through basic workflow using RStudio integration
  * all existing files in repo appear in git pane
  * ensure box is checked so these files are staged
  * click Commit button, add commit message and click commit
  * note pop up box with commit report, files no longer appear in window

* reiterate workflow by editing README and commiting with `gert`
  * status difference between tracking new files and editing previously tracked file

```
git_add(README.md)
git_commit("message")
```

* with your choice of interface, create new file, commit, delete file, commit

### Working with version history {#git-history}

Viewing history:
* click on clock button in Git pane (don't confuse with history tab; all git buttons are in Git tab)
* explain fields: subject, author, date, SHA
* click on a previous commit to see changes

`gert::git_log(max=-6)`

### Exercise: discarding a change {#ex-discard}

* make a change to README, then restore to previous (most recent) commit (pretend changes didn't exist, as if we changed our mind)

* text: if we wanted to use content from a previous commit, like the file we created then deleted earlier
  * find SHA key in log

## Working with remote repositories in GitHub {#git-remotes}

* remote vs local repositories

### Exercise: connect a remote repository {#ex-remote}

* create remote repo and connect with local

### Pushing 

defining push and pull

explain why you'd want to use these

### Exercise: push changes to GitHub {#ex-push}

* make change to file
* commit with Rstudio integration
* use push button

### Pulling

* explain pulling as inverse of pushing
* FIXME: include exercise making change on github and pulling?

## Final exercise {#05-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment for exact details on what you are required to
create and on what the package should do. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.

TODO: This question makes a change to zipfs, so this should be reflected in any automation we do to it.

1. Go to your package for your first project assignment and perform the
following tasks, noting the RStudio features and R functions you used:
    - Initialize the repository (`use_git()` in the R Console).
    - Add and commit all the relevant files that
    you've worked on until this point. Are there any you need to ignore? 
    TODO: Should we have this thing about ignore? At this point would there be anything?
    - Connect your new Git repository to GitHub (`use_github()` in the R Console)
    and push the changes up.
    - Go to your newly created GitHub repository and confirm that your history 
    has been uploaded to GitHub.

TODO: Add actions done to kenyaweather package here?
