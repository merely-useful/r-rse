# Version control: Using Git and GitHub as a sole user (part 1)

Emphasize exercises to practice,
not showing output of git in code chunks (they are a pain to edit afterwards).

Clearly identify which tasks are best accomplished by each interface.

- Using Git integration in RStudio (standard add-commit-history)
- Using Git in the Terminal of RStudio
  - moving in history with checkout
  - creating branches
  - adding and updating remotes
- Setting up GitHub for R package (make use of `usethis`), pushing and pulling

## Final exercise

<!-- NOTE: Preferably something linked to working towards completing the project assignments, maybe to be used as a milestone? -->

1. For the project previously used for demonstration in this chapter,
perform the following tasks:
- initialize the repository
- checkout a point in history
- create a new branch
- commit some new changes to the file
- what will happen if you attempt to merge your branches?

2. For your project assignment,
perform the following tasks,
noting the approach you used 
(Git integration in RStudio, command-line interface, `usethis`):
- initialize the repository
- commit all relevant files (are there any you need to ignore?)
- publish the repository to GitHub
