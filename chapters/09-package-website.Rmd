# Exposing your package to the world with a website:

- Setting up a website (with pkgdown)
- Customizing the themes
- Getting all resources and material organized
- Defining lifecycle of your package and individual functions (with lifecycle)

## Learning Objectives

* Describe the functionality `pkgdown` provides to deploy a website for package documentation
* Customize the website with pre-existing themes
* Organize the website with vignettes, tutorials and custom pages
* Explain a functions' lifecycle process and the tools to handle it in R

## Outline

* `pkgdown`

  * Text: What is `pkgdown`?
  * Text: Benefits of having documentation be code-generated
  * Text: Benefits of having a public website with the package docs
  * Exercise: Build and serve the website locally

* Website Customization

  * Text: Why does making a package website standout is useful
  * Text: Where do the `pkgdown` themes come from?
  * Exercise: Change the theme of the website to one different from the default
  * Text: Organizing beyond themes
      * Text: Transition to talking about sections, tutorials and vignettes

* Functions' Lifecycle
  
  * Text: Explain what is the lifecycle of a function
  * Text: Explain the different lifecycle stages
    * Text: {experimental --> stable --> either deprecated or superseded}
  * Exercise: Search for a superseded function in a tidyverse package
    * We can specify which package later
  * Text: Walkthrough of the process of deprecating a function

## Final exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for the participant to go through a successful deployment of a customized `pkgdown` website and documenting their function's lifecycles.

A. Setting up a website (with pkgdown)

1. Set up the `pkgdown` infrastructure
> `usethis::use_pkgdown()`

2. Build the site locally
> `pkgdown::build_site()`

3. Serve the site locally
> `pkgdown::serve_site()`

B. Customizing the themes

4. Change the default theme using `_pkgdown.yml`
> Add the yaml inside the file

5. Add a custom title and description for the Home Page
> Modify `home.title` and `home.description` inside of `_pkgdown.yml`

C. Getting all resources and material organized

6. Organize functions in the reference section
> Modify `_pkgdown.yml` to add custom sections to separate functions

6(b). Organize tutorials and vignettes (optional)
> Modify `_pkgdown.yml` to add custom sections to organize tutorials and vignettes.

D. Defining lifecycle of your package and individual functions (with lifecycle)

7. Add "experimental" lifecycle tag to one of the developed functions
> Modify the functions Roxygen annotations; `@description \\`r lifecycle::badge("experimental")\\``

8. Commit the changes and push up to GitHub. Confirm that the package website has been built.
