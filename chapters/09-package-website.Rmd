# Exposing your package to the world with a website:

- Setting up a website (with pkgdown)
- Customizing the themes
- Getting all resources and material organized
- Defining lifecycle of your package and individual functions (with lifecycle)

## Learning Objectives

* Describe the functionality `pkgdown` provides to deploy a website for package documentation and then learn to use pkgdown to deploy a website
* Customize the website with pre-existing themes
* Organize the website with vignettes, tutorials and custom pages
* Explain a functions' lifecycle process and the tools to handle it in R

## Outline

* `pkgdown`

  * Text: What is `pkgdown`?
  * Exercise: Visit the [`ggplot2` `pkgdown` page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and identify 3 benefits of having such a page 
  * Text: Benefits of having documentation be code-generated
  * Text: Benefits of having a public website with the package docs
  * Text: Talk about the build process bouth locally and through GitHub pages
  * Exercise: Build and serve the website locally

* Website Customization

  * Text: Why does making a package website standout is useful
  * Text: Where do the `pkgdown` themes come from?
  * Exercise: Change the theme of the website to one different from the default
  * Text: Organizing beyond themes
      * Text: Transition to talking about sections, tutorials and vignettes
      * Exercise: Organize the reference page so that related functions are grouped together

* Functions' Lifecycle
  
  * Text: Explain what is the lifecycle of a function
  * Text: Explain the different lifecycle stages
    * Text: {experimental --> stable --> either deprecated or superseded}
  * Exercise: Search for a superseded function in a tidyverse package
    * We can specify which package later
  * Text: Walkthrough of the process of deprecating a function

## Final exercise {#09-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub.

1. Add a `pkgdown` website infrastructure to your package by running 
`usethis::use_pkgdown()` in the R Console.
    - Test that the site can build locally (on your own computer) by running 
    `pkgdown::build_site()`.

2. Search through the potential themes and select which one you'd like for your
package website. Set your selected theme by adding the below in the
`_pkgdown.yml`, replacing the `THEMENAME` with the theme you chose.


    ```yaml
    template:
      params:
        bootswatch: THEMENAME
    ```

3. Customize your website title and description for the homepage by adding
the below to your `_pkgdown.yml` file.

    ```yaml
    home:
        title: TITLE
        description: >
            DESCRIPTION
    ```

4. Organize your package functions into sections in the reference section of
the `_pkgdown.yml` file by using the `pkgdown::template_reference()` function as
the starting point.

5. Given your package is still in development, indicate that it is
"experimental" by using the lifecycle package:
    - Setup lifecycle with `use_lifecycle()`.
    - Add the badge to your README with `use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")`.
    - In each of your R functions, include the experimental lifecycle badge
    in the Roxygen documentation right below the function title.
    
        ```r
        #' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
        ```

6. Configure your repository to use GitHub Actions by adding the appropriate
action with `usethis::use_github_action("pkgdown")`. Commit all the new
changes and push up to GitHub. Check that the Actions have been started
and confirm that the website has been built.
