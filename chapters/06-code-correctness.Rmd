# Checking correctness of code

- Using basic debugging strategies ('breakpoints', simple `print()` or `stop()`
calls, `debug()`, `browser()`)
- Unit test (with testthat)
    - While in R script, `use_test()` will create one automatically related to
    the open script.
- Code coverage (with covr)
- With devtools

## Learning Objectives

* Add a formal test of a package function using testthat
* Run all the tests for a file in `R/`
* Describe an expectation using an `expect_xxx()` function
* Enter the interactive debugger and use it to explore why unexpected behavior is occurring
* Check the coverage to tests, and suggest areas that need additional testing

## Outline of action steps 

* Adding formal tests to your package
    * Text: How do we know our code is correct? So far, informal testing with examples.  Load functions, run example code, examine output. Formal testing automates this.
    * Text: Getting set up to use testthat. 
    * Code: `use_test()`, `test_file()` (and "Run tests" button in RStudio IDE)
    * Text: The structure of test files: many tests of functions from corresponding .R file, where each test (created with `test_that()`), contains a series of expectations (created with `expect_xxx()`).
    * Text: What are expectations? Most common `expect_equal()`. Demo simple examples by running `expect_equal()` on command line.  Build from default placeholder, to example with `extract_element()`.  
    * Exercise: Replace default expectation with `expect_equal()` expectations of `extract_element()`. 
    * Text: Other expectations,  near but not exactly a certain value, type/size of output, a side effect (e.g. an error). Point to https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#section-expectations. 
    * Code: `expect_equal(tolerance = )`, with same test of `fit_zipfs()` from py-rse.
    * Exercise: Add another expectation that tests the error handling of `extract_element()`.

* Debugging your functions
    * Text: Tracking down problems.  Give code example with unexpected output.  How do we figure out what the problem is? 
    * Code: Motivation? Maybe, something like:
        ```
        > book_meta(c("Title: Dracula", "Author: Bram Stoker"))  
        # A tibble: 0 x 3  
        # â€¦ with 3 variables: author <chr>, title <chr>, release <chr>  
        ```
    Why don't we get a one row tibble back?
    * Text: Print debugging. An easy way to start, but like a postmortem, 
    can't step in and try to solve problem.
    * Code: `print()`, `cat()`, `str()`
    * Text: Diving inside your functions. Sometimes you want to try things inside your function. The interactive debugger puts you inside the function environment.
    * Code: Adding Editor breakpoints
    * Text: Navigating the interactive debugger, focus on Environment and Console, execute next statement, stop.
    * Text: Other ways to enter the interactive debugger? e.g. `debug()`, `browser()`
    * Exercise: Back to motivation, can you narrow down the problem and suggest
    a solution?
    * Text: One solution, `extract_element("Author: Bram Stoker", "Title")`, would be more useful if returned `NA`. Use tests to describe bugs - test fails now, but you'll know you've fixed the bug once test passes.
    * Code: Add tests that fail.
    * Exercise: Fix the failing tests, and confirm all tests pass. 
    
* Checking code coverage
    * Text: A way to check what parts of package are being tested. Use to guide writing of more tests.  Don't have to feel like 100% is goal, but when adding new code, generally don't want to go backwards.
    * Code: `package_coverage()`, `usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage")`
    <!-- I think I remember we are heading towards GitHub actions over Travis, hence `use_github_action` not `use_coverage()`  -->

## Final exercise {#06-final-exercise}

Complete these tasks as part of the package for your first project assignment.
Refer to the project assignment TODO: Add ref to assignment here?
for more details. As with the other final exercises,
we will use the `kenyaweather` package as an example and reference.
Don't forget to add and commit any changes you've made into the Git history
after each task, and pushing to GitHub.

1. Open one of your R scripts (if you have more than one) in the `R/` folder.
    - In the R Console, type out `use_test()` to create a unit test for the script.

1. Create one test for each of your functions in your package. You should
include tests that:
    - confirm the type of the output
    - confirm the size of the output
    - confirm the values in the output (based on a controlled input)
    - confirm the correct error messages are received when bad input is given

1. Run `test()` in your R Console (or `Ctrl-Shift-T` while in RStudio).

3. Check your code coverage in your package with `package_coverage()`.  Add at
least two tests to improve your code coverage.
