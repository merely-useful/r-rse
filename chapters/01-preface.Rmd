# Preface {#sec-preface}

Computational skills are essential in the modern research environment,
which increasingly involves large datasets and high performance
computing, along with increasing demand that scientific studies be
reproducible and open. With these modern demands, researchers across
nearly all disciplines often need to create, use, and share software.
Most introductions to programming or software engineering focus on
developing commercial applications, however, researchers needs are
largely related to exploring problems and answering questions. This book
covers the fundamentals of creating software as part of your research
cycle whether you work alone or as part of a team.

We wrote this book with three audiences in mind:

1.  **Learners in a class setting** who would be using this book in a
    more formal class or workshop setting, lead by an instructor or
    instructors. Much of the book is written with this reader in mind.
2.  **Independent learners** who would be going through the material and
    learning on their own. An independent learner can for the most part
    follow the book as if they were a learner in a class setting, with
    some modifications that we highlight and describe where necessary.
3.  **Instructors** who would use this book as the basis for a course or
    workshop of their own. Throughout the book there are sections
    dedicated to this reader that give information or instructions on
    how to use or modify the material for the instructor's specific
    context. See Appendix @sec-for-instructors for more detail about how
    to use this book for teaching.

## Introduction for learners

The primary aim of this book is to teach you the tools, skills, and
knowledge necessary to making research software that is open,
reproducible, and sustainable. For researchers and data scientists who
can write functions to create programs that are hundreds of lines long
and who want to be more productive and have more confidence in their
results, this book provides a pragmatic, tools-based introduction to
research software engineering. For researchers whose tasks include
building software packages, this book will help train you to be a
[research software engineer](https://researchsoftware.org/). Unlike
material aimed at computer scientists and professional software
developers, this book uses data analysis as the motivating example and
assumes that the learner's ultimate goal is to answer questions rather
than develop commercial software products.

Science is a process that depends on scientific results that are
accurate, precise, replicable, and reproducible. Developing software
packages for research purposes is an important way in our modern
research environment to ensure that the analyses that produce our
results are exactly that: accurate, precise, replicable, and
reproducible. Given this, the main learning goal of this book is that
you learn to *develop an R package*. By the end of the book, you will
have the skills and knowledge necessary to: develop well-built,
well-documented, and re-usable R-packages; work effectively as part of a
team or as a contributor; and optionally prepare your package to be
submitted to CRAN.

To support your learning experience, we have developed the following
specific **learning objectives** that you will master from this book:

-   Explain what an R package is, how it is structured, and how to set
    one up.
-   List and describe some best (or good enough) practices in package
    development and how to implement them.
-   Explain what a code style guide is, why it is important, and how to
    write code that adheres to the style guide.
-   Describe why user-friendly and well-written documentation is crucial
    to building a usable package and some steps to achieve this type of
    documentation.
-   Describe what CRAN is, what policies and quality-control steps it
    has for packages, and how to prepare a package for submission to
    CRAN so that it passes these checks and requirements.

Aside from the technical aspects of building an R package, the book will
also cover topics that enhance and improve the process of package
development. These learning objectives are to:

-   Describe and apply effective workflows and project management tools
    that coordinate the development of software, particularly for
    software that is complex or when working in a team.
-   Outline (and optionally practice) how to work productively in a
    small team that is inclusive and welcoming.
-   Explain why it is beneficial to involve community contributors when
    designing software and documentation.

### Who is this book for? {#sec-learner-personas}

The following personas are examples of the types of people that are our
target audience.

Amira

:   Completed a master's in library science five years ago and has since
    worked for a small aid organization. She did some statistics during
    her degree, and has learned some R and Python by doing data science
    courses online, but has no formal training in programming. Amira
    would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she has
    created in order to share them with her colleagues. These lessons
    will show her how to do this and what "done" looks like.

Jun

:   Completed an [Insight Data
    Science](https://insightfellows.com/data-science) fellowship last
    year after doing a PhD in Geology and now works for a company that
    does forensic audits. He uses a variety of machine learning and
    visualization packages, and would now like to turn some of his own
    work into an open source project. This book will show him how such a
    project should be organized and how to encourage people to
    contribute to it.

Sami

:   Became a competent programmer during a bachelor's degree in applied
    math and was then hired by the university's research computing
    center. The kinds of applications they are being asked to support
    have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis; this guide will
    teach them how to build and run re-usable data analysis pipelines so
    that they can pass those skills on to their users.

Ali

:   Learned about statistics and programming during high school and
    decided to enroll into an undergraduate Data Science program. She
    hopes to have a career working on open source projects and doing
    research software engineering for a research institution. One of her
    courses uses this book so she will be working through the material
    during the course and will use it as reference afterwards.

Luis

:   Has been doing a graduate degree that involves largely doing
    quantitative research. While doing his projects, he realizes that
    learning and creating R packages would greatly help his work as well
    as others in the group. However, he has not had any formal courses
    in computer programming. He enrolled in a course at the university
    that uses this book so will work through this book.

### Prerequisites

Learners are expected to be able to:

-   Write functions to analyze tabular data using
    [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).
-   Familiar with using the
    [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) IDE.
-   Have a basic understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and
    [GitHub](https://github.com/), and have at least used them a few
    times with basic version control tasks.
-   Create reproducible reports using [R
    Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) or
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Learners will need:

-   A personal computer with Internet access.
-   To have R, Git, and RStudio installed.
-   A GitHub account.

<!-- TODO: List of packages used and that need to be installed here as well. -->

### How to read this book

This book is structured and written in a specific way. Specifically,
there are a few "syntax" type formatting of the text in this website to
be aware of:

-   Folder names always end with a `/`, for example `data/` means the
    data folder.
-   R variables are always shown as is. For instance, for the code
    `x <- 10`, `x` is a variable because it was assigned with 10.
-   Functions (almost) always end with `()`, for instance `mean()` or
    `read_csv()`, at least when referenced within the text.
-   Sometimes functions have their package name appended with `::` to
    indicate to run the code from the specific package rather than
    loading the package with `library()`. For instance, to install
    packages from GitHub using the `{pak}` package we use
    `pak::pkg_install("user/packagename")`.

### What's the big picture? {#big-picture}

This book and the tools, skills, and knowledge being taught come out of
the growing awareness of and demand for [open
science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), [reproducible
research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility), and [software
sustainability](https://software.ac.uk/resources/approaches-software-sustainability).
So what are these?

-   Open science is a movement to make scientific data, methods, and
    results publicly and freely accessible by publishing them with [open
    licenses](https://opendefinition.org/guide/). These licenses allow
    others to re-use and modify these outputs without worrying about
    copyright infringement, often only requiring attribution to the
    original source.
-   Reproducible research means ensuring that anyone with access to data
    and software can feasibly reproduce the same or similar results,
    both to check them and to build on them. It's important to note that
    science can be open but not reproducible and reproducible but not
    open.
-   Sustainable software is when software is developed in a way that
    makes it easier for other people to extend and/or maintain it,
    rather than to replace it. Sustainability isn't just about the
    software itself, it also depends on the skills and culture of its
    users. For instance, if a software package is being maintained by a
    couple of post-docs who are being paid a fraction of what they could
    earn in industry and have no realistic hope of promotion because
    their field doesn't value tool building, it doesn't matter whether
    the package is well tested and easy to install: sooner or later
    (probably sooner) it will become
    [abandonware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonware).

This book presents software development that emphasizes openness,
reproducibility, and sustainability, because it supports both individual
researchers and the entire research community.

### Overview of the packages created {#sec-overview-packages-created}

Throughout the book, you will build at least two packages (maybe more
depending on the instructor).

-   The main example package developed throughout the book is the Zipf's
    Law package zipfs. This package is used for the code-alongs, the
    actual content, and most of the exercises. Zipf's Law is a
    fascinating result in the field of quantitative linguistics that
    states that the second most common word in a body of text appears
    half as often as the most common, the third most common appears a
    third as often, and so on. To test whether Zipf's Law holds for a
    collection of classic novels that are freely available from Project
    Gutenberg, we will write a software package that counts and analyzes
    the word frequency distribution in any arbitrary body of text.
-   The example package for the first project assignment is the Weather
    in Kenya package kenyaweather. This package is used as a reference
    when you work on your package for the first project assignment.

Specific details about the project assignments are found in
@sec-assignments. Two of the packages are completed and can be used as
references (zipfs and kenyaweather).
