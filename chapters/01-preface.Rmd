# Preface {#preface}

Computational skills are essential in the modern research environment, which
increasingly involves large datasets and high performance computing,
along with increasing demand that scientific studies be reproducible and
open. With these modern demands, researchers across nearly all disciplines often
need to create, use, and share software. Most introductions to programming or
software engineering focus on developing commercial applications, however,
researchers needs are largely related to exploring problems and answering
questions. This book covers the fundamentals of creating software as part of
your research cycle whether you work alone or as part of a team. We wrote this
book with three audiences in mind:

1. **Learners in a class setting** who would be using this book in a more
formal class or workshop setting that is lead by an instructor or instructors.
Much of the book is written with this reader in mind.
2. **Independent learners** who would be going through the material and learning
on their own. An independent learner can for the most part follow the book as if
they were a learner in a class setting, with some modifications that we
highlight and describe where necessary.
3. **Instructors** who would use this book as the basis for a course or workshop
of their own. Throughout the book there are sections dedicated to this reader
that give information or instructions on how to use or modify the material for
the instructor's specific context.

## Introduction for learners

This primary aim of this book is to teach you the tools, skills, and knowledge
necessary to making research software that is open, reproducible, and
sustainable. For researchers and data scientists who can write functions to
create programs that are hundreds of lines long and who want to be more
productive and have more confidence in their results, this book provides a
pragmatic, tools-based introduction to research software engineering. 
For researchers whose tasks include building software packages, this book will
help train you to be a [research software engineer][rse]. Unlike material aimed
at computer scientists and professional software developers, this book uses data
analysis as the motivating example and assumes that the learner's ultimate goal
is to answer questions rather than develop commercial software products.

TODO: Add more about linking why we should even write packages in the first place.

The main goal of this book is that you learn to
*develop an R package*.
By the end of the book, you will have the skills and knowledge necessary to:
develop well-built, well-documented, and re-usable R-packages;
work effectively as part of a team or as a contributor; and optionally prepare
your package to be submitted to CRAN.

To support your learning experience, 
we have developed the following specific **learning objectives**
that you will master from this book:

- Explain what an R package is, how it is structured, and how to set one up.
- List and describe some best (or good enough) practices in package
development and how to implement them. 
- Explain what a code style guide is, why it is important, and how to write code
that adheres to the style guide.
- Describe why user-friendly and well-written documentation is crucial to
building a usable package and some steps to achieve this type of
documentation.
- Describe what CRAN is, what policies and quality-control steps it has for packages,
and how to prepare a package for submission to CRAN so that it passes these checks
and requirements.

Aside from the technical aspects of building an R package, the book
will also cover topics that enhance and improve the process of package development.
These learning objectives are to:

- Describe and apply effective workflows and project management tools that
coordinate the development of software, particularly for software that is
complex or when working in a team.
- Outline (and optionally practice) how to work productively in a small team
that is inclusive and welcoming.
- Explain why it is beneficial to involve community contributors when designing design software and documentation.

### Who is this book for? {#learner-personas}

The following personas are examples of the types of people that are our target audience.

Amira
: Completed a master's in library science five years ago and has since worked
for a small aid organization. She did some statistics during her degree, and has
learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online, but has no
formal training in programming. Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, data
sets, and reports she has created in order to share them with her colleagues.
These lessons will show her how to do this and what "done" looks like.

Jun
: Completed an [Insight Data Science][insight] fellowship last year after
doing a PhD in Geology and now works for a company that does forensic audits. He
uses a variety of machine learning and visualization packages, and would now
like to turn some of his own work into an open source project. This book will
show him how such a project should be organized and how to encourage people to
contribute to it.

Sami
: Became a competent programmer during a bachelor's degree in applied math and
was then hired by the university's research computing center. The kinds of
applications they are being asked to support have shifted from fluid dynamics to
data analysis; this guide will teach them how to build and run re-usable data
analysis pipelines so that they can pass those skills on to their users.

TODO: Add undergrad persona.

### Prerequisites

Learners are expected to be able to:

- Write functions to analyze tabular data using [R][r].
- Have a basic understanding of [Git][git] and [GitHub][github], and have at least
used them for basic version control tasks.
- Create reproducible reports using [R Markdown][r-markdown].

Learners will need:

- A personal computer with Internet access.
- To have [R][r], [Git][git], and [RStudio][rstudio] installed.
- A [GitHub][github] account.

### What's the big picture?

This book and the tools, skills, and knowledge being taught come out of the
growing awareness of and demand for [open science][open-science],
[reproducible research][reproducibility], and 
[software sustainability][sustainable-software]. So what are these?

- [Open science][open-science] is a movement to make scientific data, methods,
and results publicly and freely accessible by publishing them with 
[open licenses][open-license]. These licenses allow others to re-use and modify
these outputs without worrying about copyright infringement, often only requiring
attribution to the original source.
- [Reproducible research][reproducible-research] means ensuring that anyone with
access to data and software can feasibly reproduce the same or similar results,
both to check them and to build on them. It's important to note that science can
be open but not reproducible and reproducible but not open.
- [Sustainable software][sustainable-software] is when software is developed in
a way that makes it easier for other people to extend and/or maintain it, rather
than to replace it. Sustainability isn't just about the software itself, it also
depends on the skills and culture of its users. For instance, if a software
package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs who are being paid a
fraction of what they could earn in industry and have no realistic hope of
promotion because their field doesn't value tool building, it doesn't matter
whether the package is well tested and easy to install: sooner or later
(probably sooner) it will become [abandonware][abandonware].

This book presents software development that emphasizes openness,
reproducibility, and sustainability, because it supports both individual
researchers and the entire research community.

### Overview of the packages created

Throughout the book, you will build at least two packages (maybe more depending on
the instructor). 

- The main example package developed throughout the book is the Zipf's Law package `zipfs`.
This package is used for the code-alongs, the actual content, and most of the
exercises. More details about the Zipf's Law will be introduced in Chapter
\@ref(package-setup).
- The example package for the first project assignment is the Weather in Kenya
package `kenyaweather`. This package is used as a reference when you work on
your package for the first project assignment.

Specific details about the project assignments are found in the
Appendix \@ref(assignments)). Two of the packages are completed and can be
used as references (`zipfs` and `kenyaweather`).

### For the self-directed learner

TODO: Fill this in or combine with other sections?

4. Function development in a package environment
    - Creating non-function code, checking that it works, then
      converting it into a function
        - There are several workflows for this (create in vignette Rmd, make a dev/creating.R
        script as a development location, developing in the examples Roxygen
        section, "Untitled1.R"). Which to use?
            - Mostly *what a workflow actually looks like*.

    - Using Git in the Terminal of RStudio (moving in history with checkout,
    creating branches, adding and updating remotes)
    - Setting up GitHub for R package (make use of usethis), pushing and pulling
        - E.g. with pr_* functions from usethis

    - Issue tracking
    - Labeling
    - Project boards
    - Milestones

13. Preparing for package release
    - Check builds on other systems (with rhub)
        - Etiquette for using (mostly free) servers and external build systems like GitHub Actions and rhub (e.g. don't overuse them)
    - Managing your versions, git tagging

## Introduction for instructors

The instructional design of the learning material contained in this
book revolves around three key concepts:

1. *Participatory live-coding* lessons, where participants join with
instructors to write and troubleshoot code step-by-step. We believe
that this method encourages participants to actively engage with the
material, to build muscle memory through typing, and to learn how to
handle mistakes, rather than passively observing content.
 [@Brow2018; @Wils2018]
2. *In-class and out-of-class exercises* that include independent
reading of assigned material and hands-on, practical work.
The hands-on exercises are interspersed throughout the live-coding
sessions to complement and reinforce the content as well
as give learners the opportunity to work through the code and problems
at their own pace. Reading activities are used to build concept-heavy
knowledge.
3. *Project- and problem-based assignments* that include both independent
and group-based work. For the project assignments, learners reinforce
what they learned through a new problem and challenge. The independent
work prepares them for the optional group-based work, where
they can practice team-based skills like communication, project management,
and running meetings.

More details for instructors can be found in Appendix TODO: Add ref label.
